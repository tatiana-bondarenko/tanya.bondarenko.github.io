I am an Assistant Professor in [Linguistics at Harvard](https://linguistics.fas.harvard.edu/). I study syntax and semantics, and I do fieldwork. The topics I am thinking about lately are: semantics of clausal embedding, factivity alternations, polarity subjunctives, complex agreement systems, A-bar movement. Before coming to Harvard, I got my PhD at [MIT](https://linguistics.mit.edu/) in 2022, and Master's and Bachelor's degrees from [Lomonosov Moscow State University](http://tipl.philol.msu.ru/index.php).
